# Automated-Email-Sender
This python code imports peoples emails from an csv file and automatically sends them a message with a pdf file attached.
If you don't have a csv file, it can be created via userCreation.py file. Also, the message is not limited with only pdf type file, 
but also can send images, audios or videos instead. 

Also It can be modifed to not send any attachments, if needed.

In order for main code to work, you will need to input a password for your gmail verification of third-party applications. It can be easily generated with your google account. If you will need help, it easily can be googled.
